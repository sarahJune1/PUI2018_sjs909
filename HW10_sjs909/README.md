**Assignment 1**
I worked alone on this assignment. This assignment looked at Anscombe's quartet to test different complexitites of models and see if a simpler model is better. I used log liklihood ratios to test the fit of the models created.

**Assignment 2**
I worked with Angel Lau for this assignment. I did the data wrangling and cleaning on my own and then we worked together to interpret the instructions and make our Chi Squared formula and plot our residuals and errors. 

This assignment looked into energy consumption and its relationship to total units in NYC. We created a few models to test different fits and independent vs dependent variables.
