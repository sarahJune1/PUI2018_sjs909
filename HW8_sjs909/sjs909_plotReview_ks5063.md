## Comments

CLARITY: The quantities being visualized are clear. Suggestions have been written below.

ESTHETIC:  Color pallete has been tested for color blindness in mind. Suggestions have been written below.

HONESTY: The plot honestly reproduces the data.

## Suggestions

* Color scheme for "Hispanic and Latino" is very similar to background. Changing the color or adding edge-color might help differentiate it from the background.
* Stack plot is relatively difficult for the human eye to analyze. Instead of showing multiple counties, a single bar plot with mean diversity breakdown (race on the x-axis) for counties with high female population might show information better.
