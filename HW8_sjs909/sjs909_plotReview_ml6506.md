### CLARITY
Overall, you really did a great job! It is a good way to use histogram to show the percentage. You also used another plot to expain why you chose this two counties.  However, there is one thing might be ambiguous. At first glance, since the red part(Black or Afrecia American) and light blue part(Hispanic or Latino) are so big in the plot, it is very easy for people to think Black or Afrecia American and Hispanic or Latino are the two racial majorities in this two counties. In fact, this two races has the lowest percentage.

### ESTHETIC
The colour use is very good. The plot looks so beautiful. If the word size of title and axie ledgend could be bigger, that may be better to read.

### HONESTY
The plot is honestly reproducing the data. 

### Suggestions
The plot looks very good but I think there is one thing worth to be suggested. Usually, the purpose of putting two counties data in one plot is that we want to compare them. However, according to your README.md, I think you just want to show the diversity breakdown for those counties with high female proportion. In this case, I think there is no neeed to put two counties data together. If we could create histogram for each counties and do not put all races in one bar, that might be easier to read.
