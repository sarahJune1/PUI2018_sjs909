**Assignment 1**
Here I reviewed the plots of Angel and Pablo. Looking at clarity and esthetics. I forked their repos and added my own review file in this repo.

**Assignment 2**
This notebook looks into linear regression using statsmodels. I worked mostly alone, except when creating the weights for the last question. I recieved help from Rohun Iyer to create the function.

**Assignment 3**
This notebook investigates the linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP. It was interesting (and saddening) to see the effect of the USA being an outleir.
I worked on this assignment by myself.
