**Assignment 1**
I worked on this with a few people here and there. For questions 1 & 2 I worked with Angel and Rohun, where Tanya helped with the elegant solution of avoiding a double for loop by transposing our array. Specific contributions are marked in the notebook. For problem 3 I had some more troube, luckily Rufei was able to help me understand a neat way to break down the array into a dataframe and label accordingly. Apologies for the messy ending and lack of conclusion. :(


**Assignment 2**
I used the feedback from the graph creation in a previous assignment to create two totally new graphs. My objective was to represent the data demographics with the white population in a way that shows the disparaty in diversity.
